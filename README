BCTB Style guide:
  Unlike the smootlight code, which was something of a hot mess, we are
  going to follow actual python style conventions this time.

method_names
ClassNames
variable_names
Files are modules (like java packages --> multiple classes per file)

INDENTS ARE 2 SPACES.  NOT 4.  NOT 8.  NOT TABS.  Thanks :).

If you write something that is easily testable and mission critical, write a test for it!  Put it in
the tests folder.  Consult the tests folder of the smootlight code for how
to do that.

This is going to be boss.
